					<h2>Description</h2>
					<p>
						Filipino Beef Giniling (Afritada Style) is a hearty one‑pot stew that masterfully combines easy weeknight
						cooking with comforting, rich flavors. Ground beef is sautéed with garlic until fragrant, then simmered with
						cubes of potatoes and carrots in a flavorful tomato‑soy sauce base. Alongside this savory goodness, raisins
						lend a hint of sweetness while vibrant bell peppers add color and freshness. The dish strikes a perfect
						balance of meaty depth, subtly sweet and tangy notes, and tender vegetables—all melded together seamlessly
						in about 40 minutes.
					</p>

					<br />

					<p>
						Perfect over steaming white rice, this gniling‑cum‑afritada hybrid tastes even better the next day, as the
						flavors deepen and meld overnight. . It’s undeniably Filipino comfort food—simple to prepare, great for
						sharing with family, and flexible enough for tweaks like adding peas, quail eggs, or omitting raisins if you
						prefer. Pair with fried eggs or a crisp salad for a complete, satisfying meal.

					<h2>Steps</h2>

					<ol>
						<li>Gather all ingredients.</li>
						<li>Heat oil in a large saucepan over medium heat. Add garlic and cook until fragrant, about 1 minute.</li>
						<li>
							Add beef and 1/2 cup water; cook and stir until browned and crumbly, 5 to 7 minutes. Season with black
							pepper and add more water as needed; do not let beef dry out.
						</li>
						<li>
							Add potatoes, carrots, and 3 tablespoons soy sauce; cook for 4 minutes, adding more water if mixture is
							too dry. Add raisins and cook for 2 to 3 minutes, again adding water as needed.
